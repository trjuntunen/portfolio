EXPERIENCE
Datalogz Inc. New York, NY— Software Engineer (Remote)
Feb. 2023 - August 2024
● Led the development of a Python-based CLI tool to automate the build and
configuration of the company's flagship application. The tool is used by all
Datalogz developers and customers to deploy the application and has led to
significant reductions in development time, configuration overhead, and costs.
● Developed a core feature for the company's application, using OpenAI, Python,
and React to enable users to create, modify, and execute customized workflows -
resolving identified issues within customers' data environments. This leads to
significant cost savings for customers in business intelligence as unused assets
are eliminated and developer hours are saved.
● Designed and developed a full-stack React application with a Python backend to
enhance the deployment CLI tool. This solution enables non-technical users to
initialize and build app services, as well as provision cloud resources, with just a
few clicks, significantly broadening usability and streamlining deployment
workflows.
● Developed Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates using Azure Bicep, AWS
CloudFormation and T erraform to automate the environment setup process for
quick and efficient app deployment.
Truebeck Construction, San Mateo, CA— Software Engineer
May 2019 - June 2022
● Designed and developed a comprehensive Vehicle Tracking Management System
to efficiently manage all company vehicles including a vehicle servicing
appointment system and notifications system for reporting monthly mileages all
through an intuitive SMS-based interface. T ools used include Java, Twilio API,
AWS EC2.
● Played a key role in cost savings for clients by automating daily jobsite
attendance and personnel tracking through the integration of virtual badges within
a React-based full stack web application. Deployed at over 85 construction
projects across the Bay Area with thousands of users every day.
● Implemented continuous delivery pipeline for safely deploying changes to live
service without interruption for end-users.
